				<p>Design
					
					- I think why designing skills is my strenght in this field. Being good at design can be beneficial in the IT field for a number of reasons. A good design can improve the user experience of a product or website, which is important for creating successful and popular technology. Second, good design can help make a product or website more visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing, which can help differentiate it from competitors. Finally, in the IT field, where there is often a lot of data and information to present to the user, good design can help organize and present this information in a way that is easy to understand and use.

			<h5> Weakness</h5>

				<p>Coding
					
					- It could be that I don't have sufficient practice or exposure to the concepts and syntax of the programming language i am trying to learn. It could also be that im trying to learn a particularly difficult or complex language, or that im attempting to tackle a project that is beyond my current skill level. Either way, I am working on being better at writing codes.
